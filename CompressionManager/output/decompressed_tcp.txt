   Line 1: The Collected Poems
   Line 2: Sylvia Plath
   Line 3: In ruck and quibble of courtfolk
   Line 4: This giant hulked I tell you on her scene
   Line 5: With hands like derricks
   Line 6: Looks fierce and black as rooks
   Line 7: Why, all the windows broke when he stalked in
   Line 8: Her dainty acres he ramped through
   Line 9: And used her gentle doves with manners rude
   Line 10: I do not know
   Line 11: What fury urged him slay
   Line 12: Her antelope who meant him naught but good
   Line 13: She spoke most chiding in his ear
   Line 14: Till he some pity took upon her crying
   Line 15: Of rich attire
   Line 16: He made her shoulders bare
   Line 17: And solaced her but quit her at cocks crowing
   Line 18: A hundred heralds she sent out
   Line 19: To summon in her slight all doughty men
   Line 20: Whose force might fit
   Line 21: Shape of her sleep her thought
   Line 22: None of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown
   Line 23: So she is come to this rare pass
   Line 24: Whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall
   Line 25: And sings you thus
   Line 26: How sad alas it is
   Line 27: To see my people shrunk so small so small
