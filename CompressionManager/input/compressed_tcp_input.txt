The Collected Poems
Sylvia Plath
In ruck and quibble of courtfolk
This giant hulked I tell you on her scene
With hands like derricks
Looks fierce 8 black as rooks
Why, all the windows broke when he stalked in
Her dainty acres 37 ramped through
And used 19 gentle doves with manners rude
15 do not know
What fury urged him slay
40 antelope who meant 61 naught but good
She spoke most chiding 39 his ear
Till 37 some pity took upon 19 crying
Of rich attire
He made 19 shoulders bare
46 solaced 19 69 quit 19 at cocks crowing
A hundred heralds she sent out
To summon 39 19 slight 32 doughty men
Whose force might fit
Shape 10 19 sleep 19 thought
None 10 that greenhorn lot matched 19 bright crown
So 106 is come to this rare pass
Whereby 106 treks 39 blood 45 sun 8 squall
46 sings 17 thus
How sad alas it 138
109 see my people shrunk so small 167 168
