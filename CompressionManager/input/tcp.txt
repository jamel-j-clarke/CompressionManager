The Collected Poems
Sylvia Plath
In ruck and quibble of courtfolk
This giant hulked I tell you on her scene
With hands like derricks
Looks fierce and black as rooks
Why, all the windows broke when he stalked in
Her dainty acres he ramped through
And used her gentle doves with manners rude
I do not know
What fury urged him slay
Her antelope who meant him naught but good
She spoke most chiding in his ear
Till he some pity took upon her crying
Of rich attire
He made her shoulders bare
And solaced her but quit her at cocks crowing
A hundred heralds she sent out
To summon in her slight all doughty men
Whose force might fit
Shape of her sleep her thought
None of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown
So she is come to this rare pass
Whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall
And sings you thus
How sad alas it is
To see my people shrunk so small so small
